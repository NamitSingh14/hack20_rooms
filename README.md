# hack20_rooms
# Background
The idea came to my mind through my experience in TAing during Spring quarter (the first one with all online classes). I found it really frustrating that zoom doesn not allow us to monitor multiple rooms in a meeting at once, we have to keep switching between them. This detracts from learning as it is further away from an in-person class. Usually the TA / Instructor would have a view of all the students at once.

# The Process
This idea sounded really cool but I had zero experience in backend development of any sory, let alone linking frontend and backend and on top of that, establishing peer to peer connections. I did manage to get the chat working, so users can join without a login. All they need is their username and the room name they want to join and they can start chatting! The video however did not work due to my lack of experience, it works for one room and separate from the main webapp but I was unable to integrate it.

# Objective
There is a lot of tracking involved in almost all web services we use and that continues to increase every day. My aim with this was to create an app which stores nothing, not even on your own device and provides a really fast and simple way to communicate with large groups of people. Mainly addressing the issue I mentioned in the background (although I was unable to finish it).

# Future Ideas
I will be working on this in the future and look into open source APIs for WebRTC rather than trying to work out one on my own. Quality of life features like admin control, file / image / link embeds in the chat, list of active users are something which will be worked upon in the future. Personally, I feel that making something of this scale in 1 day is difficult (just my opinion)

# Note
I have excluded a few files from this as they contain secret keys, so cloning this for your own project will not work straight away and will require some tinkering from your side.
